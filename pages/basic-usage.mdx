# How to use Wave Shell

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  **Wave Shell** uses Bun. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running

  ```bash copy
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```
</Callout>

## Setup project

```sh copy
bunx wave-shell-cli create
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to enter the name of the project. Entering the name, the project will be created and the dependencies will be installed.

Let's pretend that the project name created was `wave`. Bear this in mind, as the examples will use this name.

import { Tree } from '../components/tree'

#### File Structure:
<Tree />

Create a new file in the `src/commands` directory called `hello-world.ts` and add the following code:

```ts filename="src/commands/hello-world.ts" copy
import { WaveCommand } from 'wave-shell'

export default {
  run: async ({ print }) => {
    print.info('Running hello-world command...')

    print.success('Hello World!')
  }
} as WaveCommand
```


```sh copy
wave hello-world
```

You will be able to see the following message in the terminal:

```ansi
 Running hello-world command...
[0m [0;32mHello World!
```
